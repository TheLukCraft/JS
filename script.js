// ? let can be updated but not re-declared within the same scope.
// ? const, on the other hand, is used to declare variables whose values 
// ? are never intended to change. A variable declared with const must 
// ? be initialized at the time of declaration. The scope of const is 
// ? also block-scoped, similar to variables declared with let. However, 
// ? the variable declared with const is read-only and cannot be updated 
// ? or re-declared.
